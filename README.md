After completing a anaylis of a school district, it was discovered that the grades of the ninth graders at Thomas High School have been changed. Once we we replace the data we came to the following conclusions:
  1. It has affected negatively the passing score in math and reading for the all districtsm but not the average grade
  2. Without the ninth grade, Thomas High School is no longer a top school
  3. Replacing the ninth-grade scores affect:
  - had little effect on math and reading Scores by Grade
  - doesn't change the hierachy between the school but decrease the passsing percentage for the charter school
